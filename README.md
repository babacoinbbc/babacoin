### Babacoin Core v1.0

#### What is Babacoin?

Babacoin is a decentralized financial technology that is fast, reliable, and secure, with negligible transaction costs. It operates on its own blockchain, which is a fork of the Raptoreum codebase. Babacoin features an ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm and consensus mechanisms powered by Smartnodes, making the network immune to 51% attacks. Babacoin can be mined using both CPUs and GPUs. Furthermore, Babacoin prioritizes privacy through its integrated CoinJoin mechanism, allowing users to hide their balances directly within their wallets.

#### Problems Babacoin Aims to Solve

Babacoin aspires to create a transparent and scalable financial system that makes cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone. Here are four key areas of focus:

1. **User-Friendly Wallets**
   - Babacoin aims to simplify cryptocurrency management by deploying mobile wallets for major operating systems, such as Android and iOS.

2. **Cryptocurrency Adoption**
   - To encourage widespread use, Babacoin plans to offer a payment gateway service. This service will include a free plugin for small businesses, enabling seamless online cryptocurrency transactions. Customers can pay for goods and services using Babacoin (BBC), while entrepreneurs receive fiat currency directly to their credit cards.

3. **Exchange Accessibility**
   - Babacoin envisions a financial ecosystem where all cryptocurrencies can access investors and be traded on an exchange. To achieve this, Babacoin plans to remove high exchange listing fees and launch the Bitroeum Exchange, which will feature its own blockchain and allow any listed coins to trade against Bitroeum.

4. **Inclusive Financial Opportunities**
   - Babacoin believes in democratizing access to financial opportunities. By deploying Smartnodes, users with modest initial investments can earn coins while contributing to blockchain stability and security.

The roadmap to achieving these goals is available on our official webpage: [https://babacoin.network/](https://babacoin.network/).

#### License

Babacoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. For more information, see the `COPYING` file or visit [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

#### Development Process

The `master` branch is intended to remain stable. Development is conducted in separate branches, with tags created to mark new official and stable release versions of Babacoin Core.

Details about the contribution workflow can be found in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

#### Testing

Testing and code review are critical for development. Due to the high volume of pull requests, reviews and tests may take time. Please be patient and assist by testing othersâ€™ pull requests. Remember, this is a security-critical project where mistakes could result in significant financial losses.

##### Automated Testing

Developers are encouraged to write unit tests for new code and submit unit tests for existing code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (if not disabled during configuration) with:
```bash
make check
```
Further details on running and extending unit tests are available in `/src/test/README.md`.

Regression and integration tests, written in Python, are automatically run on the build server. These tests can be executed locally (if dependencies are installed) using:
```bash
test/functional/test_runner.py
```

The Travis CI system ensures that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, with unit and sanity tests run automatically.

##### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by someone other than the original developer. This is especially important for substantial or high-risk changes. If testing is not straightforward, including a test plan in the pull request description is highly recommended.
